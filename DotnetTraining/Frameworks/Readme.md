## Frameworks of .NET
1. .NET Framework is a large group of classes that is made available to you in the form of DLLs so that U can develop rich applications targetting various platforms and devices. 
2. It is free of cost and is available at the OS level. 
3. Framework contains ready to use classes thru which U can develop robust Apps. The ready to use classes are well tested and reliable. 
 4. C# as a language helps in developing the code and Framework gives the classes requried for the code to develop large scale application. The Framework classes are created based on the developer's experiences and requirements that have been gathered over the time.
 5. C# does not have any data types of its own. Everything comes from the .NET Framework. Including the data types(CTS types), the Framework classes(ready to use classes for developing apps) and libraries(WPF, WCF etc..).
6. Limitations: Arrays(Fixed size) are impractical. Data Storage on external devices like File System, Databases, Servers are not possible. Complex application requirements like Multi threading, OS level calls are required. SOA(Service oriented architecture) is required for distributed computing. 
7. .NET Framework has classes grouped into namespaces that can be used for developing the mentioned infrastructure in UR Application Environment. 

### Important Frameworks:
1. Collections
2. File Systems and File IO. 
3. Multi Threading
4. Event handling
5. Data base Applications. ->ADO.NET, Entity Framework, LINQ. 
6. Multi Process System.
7. ASP.NET
8. Blazor. 
9. Windows services.

5. .NET 4.5 -> 2010,12 ->.NET 4.0 without addins came into existance.(Mobile Computing).
.NET with C# 10->2022-> Shorter code snippets, improvised technology for multi devices, Blazor.
